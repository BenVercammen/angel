# angel_model
Angel's basic data model class, no longer with the added weight of the whole framework.

```dart
// Old: import 'package:angel_framework/common.dart' show Model;

// The new way!!!
import 'package:angel_model/angel_model.dart';
```

This package was created to prevent dependency collisions with third-party packages.
`framework/common` will continue to export this class.
